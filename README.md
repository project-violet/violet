### Multiple Language Support

If you want to add your language to the app,
please translate [assets/locale/en.json](https://github.com/project-violet/violet/blob/dev/violet/assets/locale/en.json).
I can translate it by Google translator, but the quality is low.

If you want to support language in source code, please refer to the following commit:
[f6babca](https://github.com/project-violet/violet/commit/f6babca1850df19e0774dbc8f708643b5038f5fd).
